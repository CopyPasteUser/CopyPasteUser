## 🚀 About Me

I'm a computer science student from Germany passionate about understanding how technology works from the ground up. Python is my go-to language for everything from web backends with Flask to automation scripts and side projects. Currently also diving deep into systems programming with C to understand the fundamentals beneath the abstractions.

**🌱 Currently Learning:** Systems programming fundamentals and exploring machine learning  
**💻 Development Environment:** Linux Mint  
**🎯 Focus:** Python development (backend, automation) and systems programming
