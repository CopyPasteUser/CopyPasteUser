# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me
Hallo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Your Name], a second-semester computer science student from Germany with a burgeoning interest in programming. While my journey in the world of coding has just begun, I'm enthusiastic about exploring different facets of software development. Currently, I'm focused on learning web development and game development, with a particular interest in creating a Doom-style renderer.

## What You'll Find Here
- **Projects**: As I continue to learn and grow, you'll find a mix of projects that reflect my journey as a programmer. From basic exercises to more ambitious endeavors like my Doom-style renderer, each repository tells a part of my story and showcases my evolving skills.
- **Learning Journey**: GitHub serves as my digital playground, where I experiment with new ideas, tackle coding challenges, and document my learning process. Expect to find repositories filled with experiments, tutorials, and maybe even a few failed attemptsâ€”all part of the learning experience!

## Technologies I Use
- **Java**: Java is my primary language, and I feel most comfortable working with it. From simple console applications to more complex projects, Java remains my trusted companion.
- **Python**: I've dabbled in Python and find it great for its simplicity and versatility. While I'm still learning, I've used it for scripting and exploring concepts like data analysis and web scraping.
- **C**: While my knowledge of C is basic, I'm currently honing my skills with a focus on understanding low-level programming and systems development.
- **Game Development**: My current passion lies in game development, where I'm exploring the creation of a Doom-style renderer. While I'm still in the early stages of my journey, I'm excited about the possibilities this domain offers.
- **Web Development**: I'm just starting my journey in web development, eager to learn frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I'm still a novice in this area, I'm committed to mastering these skills and building engaging web applications in the future.
